-------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the repository for the project on image reconstruction using autoencoders.

### Description

In this project, we aimed to explore the use of autoencoders for image reconstruction. Autoencoders are a type of neural network that are commonly used for image compression and reconstruction. They consist of an encoder and a decoder, which are trained to compress and reconstruct an input image, respectively.

We experimented with various autoencoder architectures and compared the performance of the models in terms of reconstruction accuracy and efficiency. We also evaluated the potential applications of autoencoders for image reconstruction, such as image denoising and inpainting.
